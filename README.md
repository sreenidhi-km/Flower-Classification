# Flower-Classification
This project implements a flower classification system using PyTorch and deep learning techniques. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on labeled flower images to accurately classify different species. The model leverages data augmentation and transfer learning to improve performance and achieve robust image recognition results.
